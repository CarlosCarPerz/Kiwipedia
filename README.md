<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This Github repository was a challenge that was given to us in the front-end course taught by Diego de Granda on the Platzi platform. 
The challenge consisted of creating a clone of Wikipedia, however I wanted to make modifications so that it was not an exact copy but maintaining 
its main characteristics and its responsive owner.
